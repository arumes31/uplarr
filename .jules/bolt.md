## 2025-05-24 - Debouncing frontend rendering
**Learning:** Filtering DOM events like keystrokes when rendering large file lists is crucial to avoid jank. Debouncing search inputs was needed here.
**Action:** Always look for debounce/throttle opportunities when filtering large UI lists in vanilla JS.

## 2025-05-25 - Avoid disk I/O in Mutex critical sections
**Learning:** Holding a read/write mutex while performing synchronous disk operations (like `os.Stat`) in a frequently polled endpoint creates massive lock contention and slows down the entire application (e.g., UI freezing, workers blocked).
**Action:** Always extract disk I/O out of the locked scope. Take a quick snapshot of the needed data in memory while locked, release the lock, and then perform the slow I/O operations on the snapshot.
