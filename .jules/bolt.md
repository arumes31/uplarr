## 2025-05-24 - Debouncing frontend rendering
**Learning:** Filtering DOM events like keystrokes when rendering large file lists is crucial to avoid jank. Debouncing search inputs was needed here.
**Action:** Always look for debounce/throttle opportunities when filtering large UI lists in vanilla JS.
## 2024-04-24 - Optimizing String Sorting Performance in Large Lists
**Learning:** `String.prototype.localeCompare` is significantly slower (up to 40x) than using an initialized `Intl.Collator` instance when executed within tight loops like `Array.prototype.sort()`. This creates notable jank when sorting large arrays, such as a file list.
**Action:** When sorting arrays of strings on the frontend, particularly lists that can grow large, initialize `Intl.Collator` once and reuse its `.compare()` method instead of calling `.localeCompare` directly on the strings.
