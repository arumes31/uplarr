## 2026-03-05 - Adding accessibility to toggle buttons
**Learning:** Found that layout toggles (`view-toggle-btn`) and view options (`compact-toggle`) missed dynamic ARIA attributes, leaving screen reader users without proper context of the current interface state.
**Action:** When creating toggle buttons or dropdown buttons, always pair with `aria-pressed` or `aria-expanded` and `aria-haspopup` to properly convey state changes and control relationships.
